To be able to run the project locally, first install the dependencies with:

```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

Then inside the `.env.local` file, populate the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` variable with a working [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/onboarding) API key and save the file.

Next, in order to run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to be able to view my project.

The code should compile and run properly in one step.
